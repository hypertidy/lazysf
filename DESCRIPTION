Description: Lazy read for drawings. A 'dplyr' back end for data sources supported by 
    'GDAL' vector drivers, that allows working with local or remote sources as if they 
    are in-memory data frames. Basic features works with any drawing format ('GDAL vector 
    data source') supported by the 'sf' package.
